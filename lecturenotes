1. Its important to enter the name of directory in command npx create-create-app name, same as that kept in github. Add it directly to github not through parent directly.

2. Also generate surge token in that directory.

3. Always use Capital first letter to name component functions. otherwise it will give error.

3.a Always keep the parent <div> one only that is to be returned by component to be rendered.

4. Props are passed while rendering the component, 
ReactDOM.render(<Hi name="Dave"/>, document.querySelector('#root')); //name Dave is passed

5. To recieve the props, just pass it as argument into function (props) and use it in body like {props.name}

6. Donot use {} while passing the props into function.

7. You can pass as many props as needed.

8. You can pass whole html/jsx tags like <div> or <p> as props by wrapping them in {} like body={<p>Body is here</p>}
